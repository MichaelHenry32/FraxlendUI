This is a proof-of-concept UI for Fraxlend that demonstrates a potential way to keep Fraxlend as user friendly as it currently is, while making the protocol more profitable for both borrowers and lenders by using sfrxUSD as the base asset of the protocol instead of frxUSD. In the short-term, I envision these pools to be hidden behind an "advanced UI" toggle and for Fraxlend users to default to a sfrxUSD-based Morpho vault that allows them to deposit and receive the highest earnings.
